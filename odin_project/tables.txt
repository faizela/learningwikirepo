==== Tables advanced ====

i learnt about colspan and rowspan 
why use scope for table header
 cells 
 it helps screen readers to explain what header is for 

i also the did quick learn about
how  explicit way of setting id and headers 
something i highly unlikely use 
why because too much markup more likely for error and inefficient imo
